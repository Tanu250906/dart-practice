Hey there! 
This repo has all the Dart practice files I worked on during the Flutter Bootcamp. It's a bunch of small programs covering the basics like variables, loops, functions, classes, and more. Just me learning and having fun with Dart before jumping deeper into Flutter! ðŸš€
Feel free to check them out â€” it's all a part of my coding journey.
